Start by rounding out the corners of the tape and finding the approximate length to be used for the first few steps. You can find the approximate length by following the steps without removing the adhesive substance on the bottom and seeing how much tape is necessary. When taping, make sure to stretch it slightly when pressing it against the skin, as just letting it fall on the skin will offer little support.
Place the tape above the ankle and make a vertical line downward towards the sole of the foot.
Go underneath the foot in a straight line.
Pass diagonally over the foot.
Go around the ankle in a horizontal semi-circle.
Place the end of the tape on the top of the foot, crossing diagonally. Take your time to cut away any excess tape.
Place the second tape above the ankle and make a vertical line downward towards the sole of the foot.
Go underneath the foot in a straight line.
Pass diagonally over the foot.
Go around the ankle in a horizontal semi-circle.
Place the end of the tape on the top of the foot, crossing diagonally. Take your time to cut away any excess tape.
